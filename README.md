# LinearRegressioner
A tool to assist with simple linear regression, built from scratch. Feed it training and testing data, along with some other parameters, and it will train a linear regression model!

## Details

### Training CSV File 
This will be used for training the model.
### Testing CSV File
This will be used to test the model and see how well it performs against data it has not seen before.
### Alpha (learning rate)
The learning rate of the model. If you don't know what this is, just set it to 0.001
### Number of Iterations
The number of iterations for which the model should be trained.
### Report every N iterations
Report with information every N iterations.
### Write final prediction for each test case?
This option will control whether or not the prediction of the model should be shown for each test case. Useful for small sets, but can get obnoxious for large testing sets.
### Display number of iteration vs loss graph?
This option will control whether or not the iteration vs loss graph should be shown for further insight.
